# Fuzzy-Clustering

This project started as final project of my Advanced Pattern Recognition course
Its not documented yet

still in progress...
cmeans -> good
gustafsonkessel -> good
gathgeva -> bug
linear prototype -> good
circular prototype -> good
elliptical prototype -> weak

# Demo
run test00.py a simple demo (classify instances of one prototype)


NOTE: ellipse prototype has visual problems (maybe other problems exist too cuz it doesnt work like other prototypes)
